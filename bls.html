     <h2 class="subway">The Challenge</h2>
     <br>   <br>
     <dd>We were tasked to find a non-profit organization local to us, review their website and if it could use some 
       re-working, we could choose it to redesign. I chose the Hispanic Association of Small Businesses looking at its 
       original website design which was extremely information dense and lacked strong information architecture. I also 
       chose this one because we began this project on September 15 which happens to be the start of Hispanic Heritage 
       month, the same day of Latin American independence, and the same day I was born.

          <dd>In our redesign we made it a point to better the navigation bar because the initial website was far too dense 
            with options. Instead of having a primary then secondary navigation bar, it was just a primary navigation bar with 
            over ten options to choose from. Ashereing to the paradox of choice, we simplified the navigation bar so they had 
            less options available to choose from. Instead of wasting time on thinking about which to choose, they can see 
            every option quicker and therefore get to their destination quicker. </dd>

      <br>
      <dd>After 6 usability tests with a mix of friends, family and other UI/UX design students we were able to iterate on our high 
        fidelity version of the redesigned HASB website. We went with a neutral tone in the background to maintain a professional 
        environment. As for buttons, we wanted them to have a call to action, therefore we made them a contrasting deep orange that 
        is reminiscent of Cempoalxochitl or Marigold flower. The flower whose scent helps guide the dead back to Earth and to 
        their families that Mexicans and other people who celebrate Day of the Dead use for the holiday (which was very near at the 
        time of presenting this). Being Mexican myself, I felt the need to ensure this website was a safe space to those who would 
        go on it seeking help. I also made a version of it translatable to Spanish and made sure that the button was easier to find 
        on the website unlike the original website where it was difficult to find.

      <dd>After the navigation bar, another big redesign we wanted to make was to give it a proper footer. The information 
        on the previous one looked like a long list of how you could contact them which was not the most appealing. We 
        wanted to make the information more disposable and the ability to connect with them via social media easier by listing 
        them. We simplified the types of information by their location, their social media, then how to contact them. The 
        three categories being divided by lines so the user can discern between them and their uses.

      <h2 class="subway">Conclusions</h2>
      <br>
        <p>This was my favorite project that I got to work on due to it being so close to home, literally because this place 
          was 30 minutes away from my house and symbolically because it was for my people. I felt that I had the most creative 
          freedom in thise website and felt that it had more of a personality while also maintaining a professional presentation. 
           <br><br>

           One of the challenges that was recurring in all of my projects was scheduling time outside of class to work on it. 
           We were all once again in three different time zones so we had to make sure we got down and translated the times 
           correctly. It was also more difficult being able to meet because of this but nonetheless we pushed through. 

          <br><br>
          As for future developments, I would like to allow users the option to create their own profile that way they can keep track 
          or get reminded of upcoming events as well as a record of events they have gone to before.  After that, adding a feature 
          similar to linkedin where people can become connected in a work/social environment would be sought out. Mostly to create a 
          community that is oftentimes difficult to find when you are a minority. </p>
