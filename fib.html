     <h2 class="subway">The Challenge</h2>
     <br><br>
     <dd>We were challenged with creating a low-fidelity prototype of a mobile app. We had complete 
       creative freedom for what the mobile app would be, we just had to deliver a clickable, LO-FI 
       version of the app. Hence the strong use of different shades of gray in the app’s design choices.

            We also created a survey to have quantitative data surrounding the same topic. We received 60 responses 
            to the survey and conducted 6 user interviews, two per person.

              for him to always be on the hunt for a cheaper book option for the books his college demands.

              he needs. While in office hours, a TA tells him about Fibrarian so he can perhaps connect to other 
              students on campus who may have taken the course before. He downloads the app and after some scrolling 
              and searching he connects with a college junior and borrows the book for the time being.

      <h2 class="subway">Conclusions</h2>
      <br>
        <p>The biggest challenge I faced in this group was honestly collaboration. I have always felt relatively good in all my past 
          collaborations whether it was the bootcamp or my university. However, this was definitely where my patience in collaboration 
          was tested. I felt that I clashed heads a lot and had to explain myself to one of my partners over trivial things while maintaining 
          complete professionalism. I felt like my design decisions were extremely valid and useful and many were just shut down even though I 
          had support from my other group members on those points. It was one of those cases where if they said the wall was purple, then the wall 
          was purple no matter what. I just made sure I advocated for the user no matter what and felt it could have gotten worse. I saw it as room 
          to grow and a reminder if I really wanted to be in this industry. 

           <br><br>

           Another challenge was the fact that my group was the smallest, it only consisted of three members while every other group had four or 
           five members. The three of us were all also in different time zones which made scheduling tricky but got done nonetheless. 

          <br><br>
          As for future developments, I would like to add a feature that allows users to access various libraries of followed/friends. 
          A more ambitious and preferred one would be to work in tandem with libraries/schools/local book clubs to foster an inclusive environment 
          for book-sharing and most importantly: access.
