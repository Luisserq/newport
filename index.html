                <p>Hello! My name is Luisser Quiroa (Lwee-sir Key-row-wuh) and I am a UX designer interested in Human-Computer interactive design. 
                    I love creating playable media that is easy for people to use and enjoy. My ideal client is one who is not afraid to bring their 
                    perspective or any others’ into our design process. Other than design, I love listening to music and going to any concert 
                    I can find near me. My most recent conert that I went to was Japanese Breakfast in Pomona, CA and the next one I plan on attending 
                    is Helado Negro (Black Ice Cream), a New York based, Ecuadorian artist who is finally touring on the west coat for the first time. In my free time I like learning about design 
                    and what makes it good, hence my certificate from the Georgia Institute of Technology in UX/UI Design. Other than design, anime, movies and making 
                    my own cold brew coffee at home has kept me entertained during this isolative time that is the pandemic.
