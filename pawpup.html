     <h2 class="subway">The Challenge</h2>
        <p>As there many apps out there already attempting to conquer the mobile payment, check-in and loyalty program market, we knew we had to be very thorough in our competitive analysis. By comparing everything from google wallet, to Paypal, Square, Venmo and even service apps such as Starbucks and Uber, we were to get a very clearly of what kind of technology was available and how efficient it was. The winner of the lot was definitely Uber which had the least amount of steps in the payment process. We also liked the check-in software of the company perka that used a minimal amount of hardware in store.

                questions surrounding their opinions on pets, the idea of Pawpup, and any relevant, potentially helpful 
                information. Below are the notes taken from the user interviews and grouped up under similar categories: </p>

            <p>Our user scenario and journey map focuse on Matthew Brown, a car salesman in his mid-20s who is currently unsatisfied 
                with his social life and skees out new opportunities to make friends. He also has a dog who he feels he has
                 not paid attention to as much as he’d like so he thinks it would be convenient if he could find someone who 
                 is interested in making friends with same interests like exercising with their dogs. This leads him to find 
                 PawPup through an advertisement he sees online, of which he downloads and makes a match with another user,
                 once they go on their first playdate, they end up organizing reoccurring playdates and a meaningful connection 
                 is made. </p>
