     <h2 class="subway">The Challenge</h2>
     <br>   <br>
     <dd>For my last project in my UI/UX Bootcamp, we were in charge of either redesigning an existing non-profit website or creating a 
       mobile app or website entirely from scratch. We went ahead and chose to create PawPup, a mobile app designed for dog-owners who want 
       to socialize with other dog-owners in the area. That way we foster a community both dog and people can be a part of. We pulled much of 
       the inspiration from modern dating apps like Bumble and Tinder.

          <dd>To come up with an understanding of who our users might be, we formulated a

             and their likelihood to go on a playdate with another dog owner. Below are some
              points we found from the results:

            <p>We also all contributed to a user interview research plan where we formulated 20 or so open-ended 
                questions surrounding their opinions on pets, the idea of Pawpup, and any relevant, potentially helpful 
                information. Below are the notes taken from the user interviews and grouped up under similar categories: </p>

                 not paid attention to as much as he’d like so he thinks it would be convenient if he could find someone who 
                 is interested in making friends with same interests like exercising with their dogs. This leads him to find 
                 PawPup through an advertisement he sees online, of which he downloads and makes a match with another user,
                 once they go on their first playdate, they end up organizing reoccurring playdates and a meaningful connection

            on was having a lower-navigation bar, a swiping mechanic similar to Bumble and Tinder, and questionnaire or

      <dd>After conducting a total of 7 usability interviews who were a mix of friends, family and other UI/UX design 
        students we were able to iterate on it in order for PawPup to be the best it could. We went with a vibrant orange 
        and blue color combination because we wanted to keep a friendly and welcoming themes to our users. I also found that 
        colors like blue and yellow are the colors which dogs are most responsive since they are blind to colors like red and green. </dd>

      <dd>After practicing our daily group stand ups revolving any newfound information, we noted a similar issue users 
        were having when met with the create profile screen. They were confused on what that the 6 circles were for and 
        thought they could not proceed to the next page until they finished. We instead let that be the screen where they 
        chose what image would be their main profile picture image so it would only ask for one photo which they had the 
        ability to skip. We ended up moving the option of uploading up to 6 pictures of the user and their dog to a later 
        screen with more details surrounding editing the user’s profile. </dd>
        <br>
      <div class="ppiter1">

        <dl>
          <dt style="color:#072AD0"><b>Iterations 2 & 3</b></dt>
          <br>
            <dd>Along with a welcoming and friendly theme we also wanted to have a sleek design that was visually appealing 
              for the users if we wanted them to be frequent users. We first decided that the top header of the screen could 
              be changed to the one below with the pawprint shaped as a location icon so it could look like the phone screen 
              had more open space and was less confined especially considering that our user is one who wants to go out and 
              explore more. 

              <br><br>

              The 3rd iteration was also part of trying to make the app look more appealing, therefore we went with making 
              the icons more subtle and less visually loud. We also decided to take off the title of each icon for a minimalist 
              approach which could have been better executed by maybe implementing the words that way the user does bot have 
              to constantly guess through which icon may lead to which screen. (Criticisms of that in the conclusions)
              </dd>

      <h2 class="subway">Conclusions</h2>
      <br>
        <p>Our group worked relatively well together, and we were able to compromise on design decisions if we did ever have
           differing ideas for the interface. In the end we always made sure we were advocating for our user when concluding 
           design decisions. What I wish we could have done differently is test a bit more on our Hi-Fidelity prototype so that 
           we could have prevented the biggest critique we got which taking off the titles of each button on our lower-nav bar after 
           the user was done with the coaching screen. 
           <br><br>

          For future iterations and ideas, I would like to be able to add a map feature of the user’s area where there are hotspot 
          near them of user out on puppy playdates. That way more of a group-based community can flourish and dogs can be excited to 
          go out and socialize like their owners. I also think working on how the algorithm would work would be extremely interesting 
          to work on as we can ask more questions on the survey given and be able to encourage the matching of people with similar 
          preferences. 
          <br><br>
          The biggest challenges we faced was the 3-hour time difference since I was the only one from California
          while my partners were out in Georgia. I saw this as an opportunity to get used to the idea of working remote if I ever needed to
          and just managed/scheduled my whole week surrounding this project. We were all able to consistently meet when needed to and would say we 
          functioned pretty well as a team.
